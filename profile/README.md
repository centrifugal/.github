Centrifugal Labs builds software for real-time messaging. The main product is **Centrifugo** – a self-hosted real-time messaging server, which is **stack-agnostic** and integrates with any frontend or backend technology.

Centrifugo delivers messages instantly to online users over WebSocket, HTTP-streaming, SSE, WebTransport, and GRPC. It’s built around the **channel concept**: clients subscribe to channels, and multiple subscriptions can be multiplexed over a single connection.

Centrifugo is a **user-facing PUB/SUB server** with rich features, and official SDKs (JavaScript, Swift, Java, C#, Dart, Python, Go) provide simple APIs for building real-time web and mobile app.
